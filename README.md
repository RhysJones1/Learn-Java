## How to use this repository?

This repository will contain all my notes to help me prepare for the exam. I will also include source code which will be organised in folders. I'm really just using this for my benefit and to help me track all of my work however If you stumble across it and you find it helpful then that's fine with me! ðŸ‘Œ

## How am I preparing?

To prepare for the certification, I using two modes of study:
* Udemy Course by Tim Buchulka (Part 1 and 2): https://www.udemy.com/course/java-se-11-developer-1z0-819-ocp-course-part-1/learn/quiz/4768370#overview
* OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer Complete Study Guide: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1119619130/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
* The above book also comes with 4 practice exams and electronic flash cards which I will use. While the book is aimed at the previous exam approach where there were two exams instead of one, the content is still relevant to the single exam. 
* This study approach has worked well in the past as I find sometimes, the Udemy courses don't go into as much depth in certain areas as I would like so having the book gives me the opportunity to review areas that i'm struggling with.
