# Mortgage Calculator Project

## Program Quick Guide

* Main Class: Executes the Program
* Console Class: Takes the users input
* Calculator Class: Completes the necessary calculations
* Report Class: Generates the Mortgage reports

## Background to the Improvements

In the previous version of the Mortgage calculator it was very procedural. While
this isn't necessary bad, if we were to make enhancements to the project, the 
main method is going to get bigger and in turn, become more difficult to maintain.

The next and final version of the Mortgage calculator will take an Object Orientated 
approach where will use concepts like **ENCAPSULATION** and **ABSTRACTION** in order to 
reduce coupling, increase maintainability and readability.

* Shortcut to creating constructors: Code > Generate > Constructor
Select what fields you want to initialise and then generate

* Refactor > Change Signature > Allows you to remove multiple parameters
* Refactor > Extract Method > Allows you to create methods 
* Code > Move up and Move down allows you to move code blocks without having to cut and paste
* Refactor > Extract Field > Extract Field > Implements a field which prevents repetition
* Code > Generate > Allows you to generate Getters, Setters and constructors quickly 
* Refactor > Move > Create Class > Allows you to extract classes from methods
