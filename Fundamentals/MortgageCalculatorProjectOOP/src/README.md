## Background to the Improvements

In the previous version of the Mortgage calculator it was very procedural. While
this isn't necessary bad, if we were to make enhancements to the project, the 
main method is going to get bigger and in turn, become more difficult to maintain.

The next and final version of the Mortgage calculator will take an Object Orientated 
approach where will use concepts like **ENCAPSULATION** and **ABSTRACTION** in order to 
reduce coupling, increase maintainability and readability.
