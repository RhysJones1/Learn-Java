How can we improve this code?
It's very procedural. It has a load of unrelated methods that call each other
and they are all a part of the main class. We don't have encapsulation, 
we don't have abstraction.

The next version will be around refactoring towards an object orientated design.

We can use encapsulation to package up the data and methods

We can also use abstraction to hide some of the implementation and some 
of the details.
